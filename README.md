# Enterprise Hello World

TL;DR: Use as many libraries as possible to create a Hello, World program.

This project seeks to show the world the true limit of Hello World programming.

We seek to synergize multiple projects into one cohesive enterprise and to
effectively conglomerate as many libraries into 1 product as we can.
